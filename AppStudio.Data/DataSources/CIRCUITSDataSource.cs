In a parallel circuit the voltage is the same for all elements.
Resistors
The current in each individual resistor is found by Ohm's law. Factoring out the voltage gives

To find the total resistance of all components, add the reciprocals of the resistances R_i of each component and take the reciprocal of the sum. Total resistance will always be less than the value of the smallest resistance:

Several resistors, side by side, both leads of each connected to the same wires.

A dedicated circuit, private circuit, or leased line is a line that is dedicated to only one use. Originally, this was analog, and was often used by radio stations as a studio/transmitter link (STL) or remote pickup unit (RPU) for their audio, sometimes as a backup to other means. Later lines were digital, and used for private corporate data networks.

The opposite of a dedicated circuit is a switched circuit, which can be connected to different paths. A POTS or ISDN telephone line is a switched circuit, because it can connect to any other telephone number.

On digital lines, a virtual circuit can be created to serve either purpose, while sharing a single physical circuit.A telecommunication circuit may be defined as follows:

The complete path between two terminals over which one-way or two-way communications may be provided. See communications protocol.
An electronic path between two or more points, capable of providing a number of channels.
A number of conductors connected for the purpose of carrying an electric current.
